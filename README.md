# Kat Language

Kat is a programming language designed with a primary focus on automation. Inspired by tools like BluePrism and UiPath, Kat allows developers to automate tasks through direct programming. It aims to provide a robust, easy-to-use platform for creating automation scripts and applications.

The language structure is based on the CLox language built in the book Crafting Interpreters, big credit for Robert Nystrom for creating an amazing book.
I also want to give credit to HallofFamer for his implementation of CLox, he added a lot of features that helped me understand how I could develop some others for my language.

The current state of the language differs from the main "automation language" idea since I want to have a good foundation before focusing on automation.
